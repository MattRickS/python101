# 1. Use a while loop to count down from 10 to 1


# 2. Print out every number from the numbers list
numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]


# 3. Print out every number from the numbers list, but ONLY if the number is
#    greater than 4


# 4. Print out every number from the numbers list, but stop after the number 3
#    is printed


# 5. Multiply every value in the numbers list by 5 - replace each value with the
#    new value


# 6. Print out every odd number less than 10.


# 7. Below are some animals and the noises they make. Both lists are in order.
#    Make a dictionary that maps each animal to the noise it makes, eg,
#    {"mouse": "squeak", ...}
animals = ["mouse", "cat", "dog", "cow", "horse", "duck", "chicken"]
noises = ["squeak", "meow", "woof", "moo", "neigh", "quack", "cluck"]


# 8. Below is a grid - two nested lists. Print out every value in the grid in
#    alphabetically order (ie, rows first - no sorting needed!)
grid = [
    ["a", "b", "c"],
    ["d", "e", "f"],
    ["g", "h", "i"],
]
