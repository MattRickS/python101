# 1. Write a function called add() which takes two positional parameters and
#    returns their values added together


# 2. Write a function called average() which takes a single positional parameter
#    of a list, that calculates the average value of the list. The average is
#    calculated by adding all the values together, and dividing by the length of
#    the list.


# 3. Use the add() function from above to calculate the result of:
#    (51 + 14) + (23 + 80)


# 4. Write a function that raise an error (either raise it explicitly or write
#    some code that causes an error), then call the function and catch the error
